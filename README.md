# StrongBox

## Can you trust cloud storage?

You should not.

## FAQ

### Why is StrongBox different?

* The client is open source and can be verified and audited by anyone.
* All the cryptography for your data is done in the client!
* The cryptography allows us to store your data without knowing your data.

### What if I lost my passphrase / key

* we can't decrypt your data, only you can. If your passphrase / key is strong enough, there is nothing we, or anyone out there can do for you.
* we hope you had a backup of your data, or your key.
